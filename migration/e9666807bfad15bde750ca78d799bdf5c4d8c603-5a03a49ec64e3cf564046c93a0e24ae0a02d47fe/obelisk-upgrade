# Obelisk HTTPs support

This change to obelisk affects the deployment repo of your projects. To
migrate, go to the deployment directory (if any) of your project and run these
commands:

```
echo True > enable_https
echo yourname@yoursite.com > admin_email
echo https://yoursite.com/ > config/common/route
git add enable_https admin_email config/common/route && git commit -m "Enabled https support"
ob deploy push
```

If you wish to not deploy with HTTPS you may change the value of `enable_https` to `False`.
